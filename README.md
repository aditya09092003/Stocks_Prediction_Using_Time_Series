# Stocks_Prediction_Using_Time_Series

Stock prediction is a complex task that involves analyzing historical stock price data to forecast future price movements. Time series models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and GARCH are commonly used techniques in this field. Let's break down each model:

# 1. ARIMA(AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

 ARIMA is a popular time series model used for forecasting data. It combines autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components, along with differencing to stabilize and make the data stationary. ARIMA can capture linear trends and patterns in data. It's suitable for univariate time series where the data follows a consistent pattern over time.

AutoRegressive (AR) Component: This component models the relationship between the current value and its past values. An AR(p) model uses the previous p values to predict the next value.

Integrated (I) Component: This involves differencing the series to make it stationary. Stationarity is important because many time series models assume that the statistical properties of the series remain constant over time.

Moving Average (MA) Component: This component models the relationship between the current value and past forecast errors. An MA(q) model uses the previous q forecast errors to predict the next value.

The ARIMA model is denoted as ARIMA(p, d, q), where p, d, and q are the parameters for the AR, I, and MA components respectively. ARIMA models are effective for short-term forecasting and capturing linear relationships in the data.


# 2. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): SARIMA extends the ARIMA model to incorporate seasonality in the data. It adds seasonal AR and MA terms to the model, making it effective for datasets with repeating patterns across seasons. SARIMA is particularly useful when there's a strong seasonal component influencing the time series data.

Seasonal AutoRegressive (SAR) Component: Similar to the AR component but applied to seasonal lags.

Seasonal Integrated (SI) Component: Seasonal differencing, which is similar to regular differencing but applied to the seasonal period.

Seasonal Moving Average (SMA) Component: Similar to the MA component but applied to seasonal lags.

SARIMA models are denoted as SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s), where P, D, and Q are the seasonal counterparts of the AR, I, and MA components, and s is the seasonal period.

# 3. GARCH(Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)

GARCH models are used to capture the volatility clustering observed in financial time series, where periods of high volatility are followed by periods of high volatility, and vice versa. GARCH models are particularly useful for predicting the volatility (variance) of financial time series rather than the actual prices.
A GARCH(p, q) model consists of an autoregressive part for the squared residuals (volatility) and a moving average part for the past squared residuals. Higher-order GARCH models, such as GARCH(1, 1), GARCH(2, 1), etc., are commonly used.

Keep in mind that while these models can provide valuable insights and forecasts, stock prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, including market sentiment, economic indicators, news events, and more. Hence, no model can guarantee accurate predictions, and it's essential to use these models as part of a comprehensive analysis rather than relying solely on their outputs.
